Turns your trustworthy keyboard input into fickle, uncertain input, for example, to simulate a BCI.

TO BE IMPLEMENTED
- catch (specified) keys, transform them, throw keys up again
  - or perhaps: just show the interpretation / result on screen, not transforming the actual input
- transforms to create uncertainty:
  - confusion matrix (for specified keys)
  - list of delay ranges (for specified keys)
- transforms to then again diminish uncertainty:
  - exponential smoothing
  - refractory period
  - adaptive z-score normalization ? (somewhat tricky with hard labels)
